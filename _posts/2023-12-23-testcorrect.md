## Test Reflection
- I'm not to impressed on the score I got
- I need to improve on answering correctly in a shorter time frame

## Improvements I could Make
- I would say most mistakes made were from not tracing
- Or not knowing how that part of java worked (example between .size() and .length)

## How I will improve
- First By doing test corrections (obv)
- Also reviewing more java code that isn't directly related to my project
- Maybe branching out to things in unfamiliar with during backend projects

## Q15
- My Answer: 11
- Correct Answer: 10
- Why: If the condition was <= then i would be correct but it was <

## Q29
- My Answer: The value 1 is returned.
- Correct Answer: The number of digits in the decimal representation of val is returned.
- Why: Only if the case is a one digit number

## Q31
- My Answer: B
- Correct Answer: E
- Why: I traced wrongly the pattern for the start is similar but i forget to trace the rest and just quick clicked that one

## Q33
- My Answer: II and III only
- Correct Answer: I, II, and III
- Why: the other method are still possible, I think I traced wrongly

## Q35
- My Answer: -1
- Correct Answer: 5
- Why: I read the method wrong I don't know how I got that wrong

## Q38
- My Answer: Returns 1 if the last element in numbers is equal to val; otherwise, returns 0
- Correct Answer: Returns the number of elements in numbers that are equal to val
- Why: This would be the case if there was only one element in the array numbers. But if there are multiple elements in numbers, the method will recursively call mystery until each element of numbers has been examined.

## Q39
- My Answer: Alex Alex Alex Alex Alex Alex
- Correct Answer: Alex Bob Carl Alex Alex Alex
- Why: Incorrect. This would be the case if the set method returned the value that was stored in the element after it was assigned “Alex” instead of returning the value being replaced "Alex".
