## Comands I used in shell

### wsl
- starts the windows linux envoriment

### cd
- cd stands for change directory and allows you to go into folders

### code
- Opens a VSCODE window with that file/folder

### mkdir
- makes a folder

## Where are my files stored?

### Inside the vscode folder
- created with mkdir
- Finn:~/vscode

## Local vs Github.io

### Local Host: 
- meant for experimentation, to test your code before posting it

### Github Pages: 
- meant to show your work in a website on the world wide web

```bash
#!/bin/bash

directories=("anaconda3" "gems" "nltk_data" "vscode")

for i in "${directories[@]}"; do
    if [ -d "$HOME/$i" ]; then
        echo "$i directory exists"
    else
        echo "$i directory does not exist"
    fi
done
```
