# Plans for the week

### Revamping index.md
- Im thinking about changing around my about page and getting rid of most of to put inside my index
- Also make the lab notebook TOC more accesable

### Linux Shell and Bash hacks
- Look up syntax to help make a tool checking software
- It will cd into /~
- then it will use a list of all the names of the tools to loop through the folders
